# Jay's Apples
## Easy
<div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size:18px">One day Jay, on getting his first salary, decides to distribute apples among the poverty-stricken persons. He gave each person 1kg of apples. People are coming in a queue&nbsp;and he makes sure that he gives every person 1 kg of apples only once. Every person is identified by a specific integer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Given the length of the queue <strong>N</strong> followed by an array of <strong>N</strong> integers, denoting the persons in that queue, find the minimum kilograms of apples Jay will have to distribute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>â€‹Input :</strong> arr[ ] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
<strong>Output :</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
For test case 1, the same person (identified 
by the integer '1' comes again and again in 
the queue, but Jay will not give him apples 
again and again. He gave him apples only 
once so minimum kg's of apples here 
required-1kg).

<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>â€‹Example 2:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input :</strong> arr[ ] = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2} <strong>
Output :</strong>  3 </span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function <strong>minimum_apple()</strong> that takes an array <strong>(arr)</strong>, sizeOfArray <strong>(n)</strong>&nbsp;and return the minimum kilograms of apples Jay will have to distribute. The driver code takes care of the printing.</span></p>
